Column	Description
Tissue	Body part in which the chimeric transcript was detected
Strain	Strain in which the chimeric transcript was detected
Transcript	ID of the transcript according to FlyBase
Transcript Trinity	ID according to Trinity
TEfamily	Family of the TE
TE coordinate	Coordinates where the TE was detected in the assembled region
Transcript Stringtie	ID of the transcript according to the reference-guided assembly. Most genes have a FBtr ID; those starting with MSTRG are transcripts not found in the reference annotation
Class	Transcript type code according to the reference-guided assembly
Gene	ID of the gene in FBgn format
Length transcript	Length of the assembled transcript in bp
Total number of exons	Number of exons detected in the transcript after alignment to the genome with minimap2
Expon position	Position in which the TE was detected (number)
Exon position description	Position in which the TE is detected: first, last or middle exon (3'/5' UTR, internal exon classification) or (TE inside) when detected within
Type	Types include: exon_within_TE, exon_within_TE_3, exon_within_TE_5, TE_overlap_3, TE_overlap_5, TE_within_exon
TE consensus	Name of the TE according to the MCTE library
TE superfamily	Superfamily of the TE
TE order	Order of the TE
TE class	Class of the TE
length TE incorporated	Length of the TE fragment detected in the chimeric transcripts in bp
Length TE total	Length of the TE insertion in bp
CP	Coding potential according to CPAT
status	Type of transcript according to FlyBase annotations (RNA, ncRNA, pseudogene, pre_miRNA, tRNA, snoRNA)
avgExpr	Average level of expression (in TMM, averaging the expression level of three replicates)
SS	Code specifying the meaning of FIMOenrichment column
FIMOenrichment	Motif and p-value if a motif was found with FIMO
group	1: overlap and AS insertions group, 2: internal insertions group
score	Score of the TE according to RepeatMasker (not used for downstream analyses)
position of roo	Position in the roo in which there's a match (low complexity region)
roo type	Match of the roo fragment in the consensus (low complexity region [repeat] or LTR)
