# What is happening with the distance within each cluster? Why? What would be the minimum
# distance?

#As K increases the distances become smaller since there are more cluster and therefore each
#cluster contains less points, and only the closest points form a cluster making the distance smaller.
#The minimum distance would be 0, making it that in that cluster there is only 1 point being itself the
#centroid, and with a big eoungh K that will happen to all clusters.

# Task 4) Repeat the clustering with dbscan. Use minPts = 5. Do we need to specify the number of clusters? Why?

#No we do not need to specify the number of clusters, the number of clusters will be determined depending on if the 
#points are grouped close enough to be a particular cluster or they are from different ones and if there are enough close
#enough points to be called a cluster.

# How many clusters do you identify? What is happening?

#we can identify 4 clusters, 1 for each eye, one for the face (the cirlce), and the last one for the mouth.
#As we can expect since this are the 4 different groups and they are not even close to each other to be considered
#a cluster all together.

# Task 6) Apply mclust, which applies a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Check the Mclust command. 
# What is G? How can you use it?

#The G is used to determine how many number of clusters will be
