# Raw reads from SRA experiment SRR7548448
# Description: Original WT strain, Illumina HiSeq 4000 (2x100bp)
# Insert size was not described on the SRA project, using 450bp
# ---
# maximal read length

# average insert size
avg_ins=450
# if sequence needs to be reversed (0 for short insert PE libs)
reverse_seq=0
# in which part(s) the reads are used (3 for both contig and scaffold assembly)
asm_flags=3
# use only first 100 bps of each read
rd_len_cutoff=100
# in which order the reads are used while scaffolding
rank=1
# cutoff of pair number for a reliable connection (at least 3 for short insert size)
pair_num_cutoff=3
# minimum aligned length to contigs for a reliable read location (at least 32 for short insert size)
map_len=32
# a pair of fastq file, read 1 file should always be followed by read 2 file
# we are going to use pair-end reads after filtering with trimmomatic
